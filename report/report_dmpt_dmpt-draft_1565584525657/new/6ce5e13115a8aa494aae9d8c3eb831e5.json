    "title": "Integrating Orientation and Mobility for students with Vision Impairment into the Australian Curriculum. A narrative and autoethnography inquiry",
    "description": "This study explored how one Queensland Orientation and Mobility teacher explicitly communicates non-visual precursor concepts to primary school students with vision impairment. This study examined Orientation and Mobility learning and teaching from the perspectives of students, their parents and teachers, and a panel of Orientation and Mobility specialists. These perspectives were interweaved with a detailed reflexive interrogation of Orientation and mobility lessons over one school semester within a Far North and North Queensland Department of Education and Australian Curriculum context.\n\tUsing an interpretative autoethnographic and narrative inquiry approach, and drawing on systematic introspection and on Bronfenbrennerâ€™s bio ecological systems theory, the study captured the orientation and mobility learning experiences of three primary school students. The study gathered data from semi-structured interviews, online panel discussions, and audio recordings of the orientation and mobility lessons with autoethnographic field notes, document materials, and reflexive teaching journals used to support the thematic and discourse analysis findings. Findings indicated that there is a prevalent lack of awareness of the impact of vision impairment on learning and development, and of the role of orientation and mobility within primary settings. There continues to be systemic and cultural barriers to full equitable inclusive education for students with vision impairment. \nThe findings also indicated that orientation and mobility learning and teaching overlaps with and embeds the content of the Australian Curriculum. Orientation and mobility learning and teaching exemplified a discursive pedagogical practice that creates space for dialogic practices between teacher and student, rigorous thinking, inquiry talk, and collective problem solving in focused learning episodes. The findings signposted the micro teaching skills of orientation and mobility learning and teaching as essential conditions for, of and as learning for students with vision impairment. The study also suggested that the unique craft of orientation and mobility learning and teaching could be a developing practice beyond vision impairment. \n\n",
