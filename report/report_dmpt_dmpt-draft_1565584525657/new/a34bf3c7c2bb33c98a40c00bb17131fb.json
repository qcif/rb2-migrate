    "vivo:Dataset_redbox:DataCollectionMethodology": "This study aimed to generate a theory about the process of how people with diabetes learn about their disease in the Indonesian context. Data collection involved twenty-eight semi-structured interviews with twenty-six participants. The participants included people with diabetes, healthcare professionals, healthcare providers and families. The data was collected during three phases of the study between April 2016 and July 2017. All interviews were conducted in the Indonesian language and thus the process of data analysis involved both English and Indonesian languages.",
